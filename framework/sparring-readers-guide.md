## Abstract

This document is a reader's guide to the SPARRING methodology's document set. It identifies the intended audiences, names what the document set deliberately does not serve, and provides reading-order recommendations by reader role. The set comprises three documents: the Specification (formal methodology definition), the Reference Implementation (concrete CLI-based deployment architecture), and this guide. The guide is not a substantive technical contribution; it is meta-navigation. Three concentric audiences are addressed by the document set as a whole, with each audience finding different documents most useful as primary reading: independent practitioners and small-team founders building agentic systems (primary); academic LLM-behavior and multi-agent-systems communities (secondary); and AI architects, tech leads, and consultants evaluating agentic-system design choices (tertiary). The audience tiers meet at the worked persona examples (Marcus and Dani as a code-review SPARRING pair) in the Reference Implementation, which function simultaneously as copyable templates, concrete instantiations of the abstract two-layer persona model, and evaluation references. Distribution implications and reading paths by role are provided in closing sections.

## 1. Purpose and scope of this guide

The SPARRING methodology's document set is a coordinated technical contribution: a Specification that establishes SPARRING's structural commitments and an Implementation Guide that specifies a concrete reference architecture realizing those commitments. Both documents are substantive in their own right and can be read independently. They serve different purposes for different audiences, however, and a reader arriving at the document set without orientation may find it difficult to determine which document is most relevant to their needs.

This guide addresses that orientation problem. It does three things: (1) identifies the documents in the set and their relationship to one another; (2) characterizes the audiences the documents are written to serve, distinguished by tier; (3) recommends reading paths through the documents by reader role. This guide is not itself a substantive technical contribution. It does not introduce methodology concepts, architectural commitments, or implementation guidance. Such material lives in the Specification and the Implementation Guide; this guide points at them.

The guide also names what the document set deliberately does not serve. Audiences exist that the documents could plausibly be marketed to but were not written for; explicit exclusions reduce friction for readers in those audiences who would otherwise expect the documents to address their concerns.

## 2. The document set

The SPARRING methodology's document set comprises three documents:

**The Specification** [@niedner2026specification] establishes SPARRING's formal definition. It addresses the compounding-failure problem in agentic systems, defines the four phases (SPARK, Pattern Lock, the Cut, the Resolver) and the SPARRING two-role mechanic (Generator and Challenger with role-shifting Challenger function), specifies the nine operational disciplines that prevent collapse to theatrical adversariality, and provides a disagreement-at-cap response protocol with five canonical responses. The Specification also names the failure modes SPARRING defends against, the explicit boundaries of its applicability, the conditionalities that bound its quality leverage, and an honest critique of SPARRING applied to itself. The Specification is the primary artifact for academic publication and is suitable for arXiv preprint deposit or workshop-paper submission.

**The Reference Implementation** [@niedner2026implementation] specifies a concrete architecture for deploying SPARRING as a CLI tool. It establishes a discipline-to-component mapping, defines the twelve major components in four architectural layers, specifies the agent topology that runs at invocation time, develops a two-layer persona model (mandatory Role + Domain Knowledge plus optional Persona) with a three-class lifecycle (persistent, returning, temporary), provides a phased build sequence from MVP through enterprise scale, and includes a worked Phase 1 walkthrough with two complete persona examples (Marcus and Dani, drawn from the Lifspel reference deployment as a code-review SPARRING pair). The Reference Implementation is longer than the Specification and serves as the primary artifact for engineering practitioners.

**This Reader's Guide** orients new readers by audience and by role. It is the shortest of the three documents and the appropriate entry point for any reader who is not yet certain which document fits their purpose.

The three documents are related but independently readable. A reader can engage any one without the others, though cross-references throughout each document point to relevant sections of the others where appropriate. The Specification establishes terminology and structural commitments that the Reference Implementation operationalizes; readers approaching the Reference Implementation without first reading the Specification will encounter forward references to disciplines and definitions that are explained in the Specification's body.

## 3. Target audience

Three concentric audiences are addressed by the document set as a whole. Each audience finds different documents most useful as primary reading, and each has different expectations about depth, citation discipline, and structural rigor.

### 3.1 Primary audience: independent practitioners and small-team founders

The primary audience is people who are designing or operating multi-agent systems for real products. The canonical case is a solo developer or small-team lead working on a small-group product, where "small-group" denotes a product whose user base is tens to hundreds of partners (creative-work tools, narrative-authoring engines, internal decision-support utilities, character-friendly product surfaces). Worked examples in the Reference Implementation reflect this audience explicitly.

This audience has practical experience with large language models (prompt engineering, tool use, basic familiarity with reinforcement learning from human feedback) and has likely built or adapted at least one agentic prototype. The compounding-failure problem SPARRING addresses is one this audience encounters firsthand: their multi-agent prototypes feel sophisticated but produce convincing-looking outputs they are not sure they trust. The audience is looking for structural patterns that can be adopted incrementally without buying into a vendor's full framework.

The Reference Implementation is the principal artifact for this audience. Its concrete architecture, the complete Marcus and Dani persona examples, the Phase 1 MVP walkthrough, and the phased build sequence are all calibrated to the practitioner's question: "what do I actually build?" The Specification serves this audience as background reading that explains why the architectural choices in the Reference Implementation are calibrated as they are; reading the Specification is recommended but not required for adoption work.

### 3.2 Secondary audience: academic LLM-behavior and multi-agent-systems communities

The secondary audience is researchers working on areas SPARRING addresses or relates to. Three subcommunities within this audience are likely to engage the document set:

- **LLM behavior researchers** working on sycophancy reduction, model evaluation, preference learning, RLHF, and adversarial methods. SPARRING's family-of-failure-modes framing (Specification Section 4) and its honest-critique-of-SPARRING section (Specification Section 5) are calibrated to this community's expectations of intellectual rigor.
- **Multi-agent systems researchers** working on coordination patterns, agent specialization, and evaluation of multi-agent quality. SPARRING's nine disciplines (Specification Section 3.3) and its analysis of theatrical adversariality (Specification Section 5.2) speak to this community's design concerns.

The Specification is the principal artifact for this audience. Its academic structure (abstract, related work, methodology definition, discussion, limitations, conclusion, references) is calibrated to peer-reviewable rigor and to the citation expectations of the targeted venues. Likely venues include arXiv preprint deposits in the cs.MA (Multi-Agent Systems) and cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) categories, workshops at AAAI, AAMAS, ICML, and ACL on multi-agent and LLM-behavior topics, and tech-report distribution through institutional repositories where applicable.

### 3.3 Tertiary audience: AI architects, tech leads, and consultants

The tertiary audience is engineers and architects at established organizations who are evaluating whether to adopt agentic patterns at scale, advising clients on AI deployment, or auditing existing multi-agent systems for known failure modes. They are not building from scratch; they need vocabulary, evaluation criteria, and analytical frameworks for internal architecture reviews and consulting engagements.

This audience is principally served by sections that operate as evaluation references rather than as build guides: the conditionalities in the Specification (Section 5.1), the applicability boundaries (Specification Section 4.3), and the discipline-to-component mapping in the Reference Implementation (Section 2.1). The audience cites SPARRING in internal architecture reviews and consulting deliverables rather than building against it directly.

Both the Specification and the Reference Implementation are useful for this audience, but a reader should prefer the Specification for evaluation work that emphasizes "what should an agentic decision-making system commit to" and the Reference Implementation for evaluation work that emphasizes "what should an agentic decision-making system look like in practice."

## 4. What the document set deliberately does not serve

Several audiences exist that the document set could plausibly be marketed to but was not written for. Naming them explicitly reduces friction for readers in those audiences who would otherwise expect the documents to address their concerns.

**End users of agentic products.** The document set contains no marketing copy and no value-proposition pitch. A consumer reading either substantive document would find no orientation toward "what does SPARRING do for me as a user." Such material may be authored separately for product-marketing contexts, but is not part of this document set.

**First-time learners of LLMs and agentic systems.** The documents assume familiarity with large language models, prompt engineering, reinforcement learning from human feedback, multi-agent systems vocabulary, and at least passing knowledge of cognitive bias literature. Readers without this background will find the documents difficult to engage. Introductory material on these topics is widely available elsewhere; the document set does not duplicate it.

**Regulators and policy researchers.** While the documents touch on regulated-environment deployment (compliance frameworks such as SOC 2 are mentioned, and liability concerns for medical, legal, and financial decision-support contexts are noted), the documents are not policy artifacts. A policy researcher would find them too implementation-focused to serve regulatory analysis needs directly.

**Foundation-model researchers.** SPARRING operates at the deployment layer, downstream of foundation-model design. Researchers working on model architectures, training methods, or scaling laws would find SPARRING downstream of their primary concerns, though SPARRING's named failure modes and its training-layer-mitigations notes (Specification Section 5.2) reference foundation-model research where relevant.

**AI alignment researchers in the narrow sense.** Researchers working on deceptive alignment, mesa-optimization, scalable oversight, or reward hacking will find SPARRING operates at the deployment / multi-agent coordination layer, not the training / inner-cognition layer. SPARRING's named failure modes overlap with sycophancy research, but its structural defense does not address the alignment-research community's central concerns. LLM-behavior researchers working on the documented behavioral failure modes are explicitly part of the audience (Section 3.2); the broader alignment-research community is not.

**Adopters seeking turnkey software.** The Reference Implementation is a specification of what to build, not a software distribution. Readers expecting downloadable software with installation instructions will not find it; the implementation work is left to the adopter.

## 5. Where the audience tiers meet

The Reference Implementation's worked persona examples (Section 3.3, demonstrating Marcus and Dani as a code-review SPARRING pair) are the artifacts that bridge all three audience tiers and warrant explicit attention as the document set's most-trafficked objects.

The primary audience uses Marcus and Dani as copyable templates. Each example is presented as a complete persona file that an adopter can adapt by substituting domain-specific content for the placeholder content; the pair together demonstrates Discipline 2 (distinct evidence bases) at the worked-example level. The structural rules (the two-layer model, the depth-with-function principle) apply directly to the adopter's authored personas.

The secondary audience reads Marcus and Dani as concrete instantiations of the abstract two-layer model defended in the Specification (Section 3.3). Without the worked examples, the abstract model is difficult to evaluate for completeness or for claims about its applicability across more than one persona shape; with two examples that share a project but differ in evidence-base scope, the model becomes inspectable and falsifiable.

The tertiary audience uses Marcus and Dani as evaluation references. When auditing an existing agentic system, the question "does this system's persona structure match what a SPARRING-shaped persona requires" is operationalized by comparison against the worked examples. The pair serves as a checklist target for evaluation work, with the SPARRING pairing as a reference shape for D2 compliance.

The decision to retain Marcus and Dani by name rather than genericizing to strictly role-based personas (e.g., "the code-reviewer" and "the security-specialist") was load-bearing for this bridging function. Genericized examples would have been cleaner from a project-decoupling standpoint but would have lost the concreteness that makes the examples useful across audience tiers. Both worked personas are attributed to the Lifspel reference implementation [@niedner2026lifspel] in the Reference Implementation's body so that readers understand the examples' provenance without inferring that SPARRING is Lifspel-specific.

## 6. Distribution and discovery

For maximum reach across the three audience tiers, the document set should land in three distribution surfaces:

**arXiv** as a preprint, with the Specification as the primary submission and the Reference Implementation either as a separate technical-report submission or as supplementary material to the same submission. arXiv is the primary discovery surface for the secondary audience and is increasingly used by the primary audience as well.

**A public source-control repository** (GitHub, GitLab, Codeberg, or similar) hosting the documents in their markdown source form. This surface allows the primary and tertiary audiences to fork, adapt, and contribute. It also enables the use of the documents as project documentation for adopters who reference SPARRING in their own projects.

**A discovery layer** (LinkedIn announcement, personal or institutional blog, conference talk, podcast appearance) pointing at the canonical sources. The primary audience does not routinely scan arXiv; the discovery layer reaches them where they are. The form of the discovery layer should be calibrated to the author's existing distribution capabilities and audience reach.

The three surfaces serve complementary functions. arXiv provides citation-grade permanence and a known discovery channel for academic readers. The repository provides workable source for adopters and is the primary surface for community contribution. The discovery layer provides reach to readers who would not otherwise encounter the work.

## 7. Reading paths by role

The following reading paths are recommended starting points by reader role. None is prescriptive; readers are encouraged to deviate based on their needs.

**For practitioners building a Phase 1 MVP deployment (primary audience):**

1. This Reader's Guide (current document) -- 10 minutes.
2. Reference Implementation, Section 1 (Introduction) and Section 2 (Architecture) -- 30 minutes.
3. Reference Implementation, Section 3 (two-layer persona model) and Section 4 (three-class persona lifecycle) -- 45 minutes.
4. Reference Implementation, Section 5 (Phase 1 MVP walkthrough) -- read while building -- 2-4 hours including build time.
5. Specification (background reading after a working Phase 1 deployment) -- 1 hour.
6. Reference Implementation, Section 6 (phased build sequence) when planning Phase 2 work -- 30 minutes.

**For academic readers preparing a related paper or evaluating SPARRING's claims (secondary audience):**

1. This Reader's Guide -- 10 minutes.
2. Specification, full read -- 2-3 hours including reference review.
3. Reference Implementation, Section 2 (Architecture) and Section 3 (persona model) for structural detail -- 45 minutes.
4. Reference Implementation, Section 7 (Honest tradeoffs) for the adopter-side critique -- 15 minutes.

**For architects, tech leads, and consultants conducting evaluation work (tertiary audience):**

1. This Reader's Guide -- 10 minutes.
2. Specification, Sections 3 (Methodology definition) and 5 (Discussion) -- 1 hour.
3. Reference Implementation, Section 2 (Architecture) and Section 7 (Honest tradeoffs) -- 45 minutes.
4. Specification, Section 4 (Failure modes addressed) and Section 6 (Limitations) for analytical positioning -- 30 minutes.

**For all readers:**

A revisit to the Specification's Section 5.3 (Honest critique applied to SPARRING itself) is recommended after reading either substantive document in full. The section names concerns SPARRING's authors take seriously, including those that survive PNP applied to SPARRING. Reading it informs both adoption decisions and evaluation work.
